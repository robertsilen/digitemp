1-wire temperature sensor polling and data logging to MySQL/MariaDB.
Coded in 2006.
##############

		MySQL/MariaDB database logging of temperatures.
		
		FILE LOCATIONS:
		DS_XXXX binary: /usr/local/bin/digitemp/digitemp
		config file: /usr/local/bin/digitemp/digitemp.cfg
		MySQL/MariaDB perl script file: /usr/local/bin/digitemp/digitemp_mysql.pl
		
		NORMAL OPERATION:
		The operation goies like this:
		cron (anacron) executes the digitemp_mysql.pl script 
		which uses the digitemp binary 
		which uses the cofig file
		
		MANUAL OPERATION:
		the perl script can be run by hand with -d/-v options for debugging
		the digitemp binary can be run by hand with -s /dev/ttyS0 and other options
		
		INSTALLATION:
		
		Create a new database named digitemp:
		mysqladmin create digitemp -u root -p

		Edit the mysql_grant_rights.sql file and change the password and
		optionally the username. Grant access to the new database:

		mysql mysql -u root -p < mysql_grant_rights.sql

		Create the database tables:

		mysql digitemp -u root -p < mysql_create_tables.sql
		
		See also the digitempdump.sql

		Edit the digitemp_mysql.pl script. Change the password to the
		one you used above, optionally change the username.
		Point the digitemp_rcfile variable to the DigiTemp config file
		that you have previously created using digitemp -i -c rcfile

		I recommend using one other than .digitemprc so that it isn't
		accidently erased when you run digitemp -i from your home
		directory.

		Make sure the path to the digitemp binary is correct. It is
		specified by the $digitemp_binary variable.
		You could copy the /usr/bin/digitemp_DS????? to /usr/lib/bin/digitemp/digitemp

		Setup a cron job to log temperatures to the database at
		regular intervals (in /etc/crontab):

		*/5 * * * *   /usr/lib/bin/digitemp/digitemp_mysql.pl
